# BILLING_UNAVAILABLE

[androidJvm]\
[BILLING_UNAVAILABLE](index.md)

A user billing error occurred during processing.

Examples where this error may occur:

- 
   The user is in an unsupported country.
- 
   The user is an enterprise user and their enterprise admin has disabled users from making purchases.
- 
   The Billing service is unable to charge the userâ€™s payment method.

Letting the user retry may succeed if the condition causing the error has changed (e.g. An enterprise user's admin has allowed purchases for the organization).
